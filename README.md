# InitColor

A color initializer for your python program!

So this is an efficient IMO. 


It has multiple features, as listed below

|Feature|Description|
|--|--|
|RGB|Choose your own color using RGB codes|
|Bold|Makes the text darker|
|Dim|Makes the text lighter|
|Italic|Makes the text slanted|
|Underline|Makes the text output with an underline|
|Swap Foreground and Background|Makes the text and background switch colors|
|Hidden|Makes the text invisible|
|Reset|Resets all **attributes**|
|Reset All|Resets everything|

## Syntax:

It's simple. Simply this:

```py
InitColor(red = 0, green = 0, blue = 0, bold = True, dim = True, italic = True, unerlined = True, swap_foreground_and_bg_colors = True, hidden = True, reset = True, reset_all = True)

# Replace the 0's and the True's with what you want
```

If at anytime, you find a bug/error in the program, please let me know and I will fix it as soon as possible

So, I guess that is the whole program, and I hope you find this useful!
